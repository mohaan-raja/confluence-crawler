<h1>Title: Application Bootstrap Performance Improvement</h1><p>Currently the 'forms' metadata is fetched from the API service on every application server. The proposal is to change this behaviour and cache this information in the browser local storage and fetching it from the server only when the data is stale.</p><p>The validity of the <span>'forms' </span>metadata will be computed based on a version key that will be recorded against every role. This key will be cached in the local storage every time the <span>'forms'</span> metadata is fetched from the server. Every time the user loads the application this key will be injected into the application html and thereby into the window object (similar in fashion to the locale variable).</p><p>On application bootstrap the keys in the window object and local storage will be verified to identify stale metadata. If stale, data will be fetched from the server and the cache will be updated. If not stale the data will be loaded to the ember store from the local storage.</p><p><br/><br/></p>
