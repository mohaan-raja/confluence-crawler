<h1>Title: I18N</h1><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Best Practices</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Based on the feedback we received from the translators. Translators face difficulty in understanding the context on many strings we used in our product. We have consolidated few major issues they reported. Lets adhere to the best practices in order to help and improve the quality of translation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Don’t break the sentences. Breaking the sentence may mislead the context of the String to be translated which in turn ruin the quality of translation. Use variables wherever necessary.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Contact/Lead/Account cannot be part of variable, use separate content for each of this. So far, we have represented {{entity}} in our strings to replace one of Contact/Lead/Account. We need to avoid such representation, because this has different linguistic characteristics across language, so no single grammar fits for all of these.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Keep more attention to pluralization, “Contact” and “Contacts” are handled in a completely different way. Don’t ever use suffix(s) to indicate plurals, i.e., using same string string for plurals. Use “one&quot; and “other” substrings.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">While passing something like “scheduled” or “sent” as values for variables from the code,  than ensure those texts are already I18nized.</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Hope everyone aware that we have changed our translation tool from Onesky to Crowdin. And the transition enabled us to automate few tasks using crowdin api, so that anyone can update source(en.yml) or download translations without having access to the tool.</span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Crowdin Auto Sync</span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We have automated updating the source file to crowdin. So, Once in two weeks en.yml file will be pushed to crowdin provided the following conditions applied.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Will be pushed only if,</span></p><ol><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p>It is staging-rails stack</p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p>the Git branch deployed is staging (crowdin version sticks to staging version)</p></li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><p>the last crowdin update happen two weeks before</p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Once uploaded, we will send email to all stake holders(‘freshsales-eng’,’freshsales-pm’,etc.,). Mail has the following info,</span></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p>Owners - people who have committed in en.yml since last update</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p>Branch - Branch from which en.yml gets updated</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p>Crowdin Response</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><p>Language wise translation status after the updated source file</p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">We have created two tasks in language rake, “upload” and “download”. Tasks should be called with a environment parameter ‘key’.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">To download all the translated strings, call “bundle exec rake language:[download/upload] key=&lt;crowdin-api-key&gt;”</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Translation Process</span></strong></p><p>Those who made the recent changes will be mentioned as Owners in the mail sent after auto sync. And these owners can follow-up with the PM in-charge for translation to order for translations. Here in after it will be taken care by Swati from PM Team.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">PS: It has been assumed that our staging branch has only finalized strings.  So, please ensure there will not be much change in strings after it comes to staging.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br/></span></p>
