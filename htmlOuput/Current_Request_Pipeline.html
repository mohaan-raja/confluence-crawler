<h1>Title: Current Request Pipeline</h1><p><h3 id="CurrentRequestPipeline-Leads/Contacts/Accountspages">Leads/Contacts/Accounts pages</h3><p>Currently, the application request pipeline is as follows:</p><ol><li>Application bootstrap<ol><li>Session</li><li>Integration</li><li>Forms</li><li>Lead Stages</li><li>Deal Stages</li></ol></li><li>Route<ol><li>Filters/Views/Segments</li><li>Saved Filters</li></ol></li><li>Controller<ol><li>Filter Options</li><li>Entity Info (Leads/Contacts/Accounts)</li></ol></li></ol><p>The requests in each layer (application bootstrap/route/controller) are in most cases parallel. However, the pipeline between layers is sequential. This essentially means that the request to fetch the most usefulÂ data to the end-user is the last to get triggered. This results in a pretty significant delay.</p></p>
