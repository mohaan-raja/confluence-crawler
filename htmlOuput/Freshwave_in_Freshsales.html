<h1>Title: Freshwave in Freshsales</h1><p><span><a href="https://confluence.freshworks.com/display/FRESWAVE/Freshwave" rel="nofollow">Freshwave</a> is an agile implementation in Freshworks that aims to incrementally work towards predictable product development by ensuring customer delight and employee engagement.</span></p><h2 id="FreshwaveinFreshsales-Sprint"><span>Sprint</span></h2><p><span>As part of Freshwave, we will adopt a sprint model of working. Though the duration of the sprint can be decided by the squad, the recommendation is to adopt 2 weeks sprint model. Each sprint will have 10 days and several Freshwave ceremonies will be scheduled appropriately. A typical sprint calendar can be seen below,</span></p><div class="table-wrap"><table class="relative-table wrapped confluenceTable" style="width: 71.2977%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 24.3562%;"/><col style="width: 18.8841%;"/><col style="width: 17.382%;"/><col style="width: 16.9528%;"/><col style="width: 22.4249%;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 1</strong></p><p>Sprint planning</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 2</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 3</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 4</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 5</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 6</strong></p><p>Product Backlog Grooming</p><p>for Next Sprint</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 7</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 8</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 9</strong></p><p>Daily standup</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Day 10</strong></p><p>Sprint Demo &amp; Deployment</p><p>Sprint Retrospective</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As part of the sprint, we will have several sprint ceremonies which are briefed below.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://confluence.freshworks.com/display/FRESWAVE/Sprint+Ceremonies" rel="nofollow">Sprint Ceremonies</a></strong></li></ul><ol><ol><li><strong>Product Backlog Grooming</strong><span><br/><strong>Who?</strong> Squad members, EM, PM &amp; TPM, Tech Arch</span><span><br/><strong>What?</strong> EM will work with PM and Tech Arch to identify epic, user stories, tech stories and other items that can be groomed. The list of items to be groomed will have to be shared with the team <u>2 days before grooming</u>. This would help squad members to go through the list and come up with informed questions. In the grooming meeting, PM will explain the user stories in detail and clarifies the queries from the squad members. All the tickets that are meeting the <strong>Definition of Ready</strong> will be picked up in Sprint planning.</span><span><br/><strong>Output - </strong>Once tickets are groomed, they should be estimated with story points.<br/><br/></span></li><li><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Sprint Planning</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br/><strong>Who?</strong> Squad members, Optional - EM &amp; TPM</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br/><strong>What? </strong>Squad members will discuss availability and start picking tickets based on priority from the product backlog.</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br/><strong>Output - </strong>Squad board created with all tickets that are picked by developers and QAs with clear ownership and plan. Developers and QAs will pick tickets and effort in days for each ticket will be filled by each one. We can also fill effort in days for each stage such as 'Development', 'QA', 'Review' etc.<br/></span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Daily Standup<br/></strong></span><strong style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Who? </strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Squad members<br/></span><strong>What? </strong>Squad members meet on a daily basis to discuss i) what is the plan for the day? ii) What are the blockers?<br/><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><strong>Output -  </strong>Tickets in Freshrelease have to be updated regularly.<br/><br/></span></li><li><strong>Sprint Demo &amp; Deployment<br/></strong><span><strong>Who? </strong>Squad members, EM, PM, TPM, Tech Arch<br/></span><span><strong>What?</strong> Squad members will give the demo to all stakeholders and take inputs. </span><span><br/><strong>Output - </strong>Every sprint will see a mandatory deployment on this day.
