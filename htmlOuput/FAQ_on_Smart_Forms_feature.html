<h1>Title: FAQ on Smart-Forms feature</h1><p><strong>Q1: How to confirm whether the Javascript has been installed successfully in my website?</strong></p><p>1. After pasting the installation script in your website's headers, access your website in Chrome Browser.</p><p>2. Open the Developer tools.</p><p>3. Click the &quot;Network&quot; tab and select &quot;Preserve log&quot; option.</p><p>4. Refresh your Website and check if a request made to yourdomain.freshsales.io/track/visit.json URL. If this is returning 200 status, you can confirm the successful installation.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q2: How to confirm whether all the Forms in my website are auto-captured?</strong></p><p>1. You can access any one your website's form in Chrome Browser.</p><p>2. Open the Developer tools.</p><p>3. Now, do a dummy click on the Submit button of the Form. You can see a request made to yourdomain.freshsales.io/track/visit.json URL. If this is returning 200 status, you can confirm the successful installation.</p><p>4. In order to check if the data is being captured under right fields inside CRM, fill sample data in the Form and click submit.</p><p>5. Now, access your CRM in an another tab in the browser and navigate to &quot;New leads&quot; view. You should be able to find the lead that got created for the sample data you provided in the Form.</p><p>6. You can repeat this same procedure for all the forms in your website to confirm auto-capturing for Forms.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q3: How does smart forms script map Website Form's fields to CRM fields?</strong></p><p>1. Script installed in your Website will capture the Form Field's label, name, id, placeholder and type.</p><p>2. These properties of the form's fields are later compared against the fields available in CRM using a field mapping algorithm.</p><p>3. Once algorithm maps the fields, data from respective form fields is copied into CRM and created as Lead.</p><p>4. If our algorithm couldn't exactly map few of your form's fields, it adds the data of those fields as a Note under the specific Lead.</p><p>5. Note added under the Lead also gives you a hint of the label that you need to use to create a new Custom field inside CRM.</p><p>6. Once you create a custom field with the suggested label, our algorithm will map the data from later Form submissions under right fields instead of adding it under Note.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q4: Why is smart forms script not woking for my Form?</strong></p><p>Auto form capturing works as our script adds Submit hooks for the Forms in your website. If the form is added in the website using an Iframe, smart forms script will not be able to add the submit hooks for that form. Verify if this is the scenario for your form.</p><p>Iframe scenario:</p><p>Try to see if you can add the installation script in the Iframe itself in the same way that you added in the Website's header. If you do this, auto form capturing will work for the form.</p><p>Other scenario:</p><p>Smart forms script uses few JQuery selectors to separate out the submit buttons from the rest of the buttons present in your Website. We came up with these JQuery selectors after doing a thorough analysis of Form building standards. Those selectors are listed below. Check if your form's submit button falls under any of these selectors. If not, try to match with any of these selectors. If you do this, auto form capturing will work for the form.</p><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;[&quot;input[type='submit']&quot;, &quot;input[type='button']&quot;, &quot;input[id='submit']&quot;, &quot;form input[type='image']&quot;, &quot;form input[type='submit']&quot;, &quot;form input[type='button']&quot;, &quot;form input[id='submit']&quot;, &quot;button[type='submit']&quot;, &quot;button[type='button']&quot;, &quot;button[id='submit']&quot;, &quot;form button[type='submit']&quot;, &quot;form button[type='button']&quot;, &quot;form button[id='submit']&quot;, &quot;form a:textcontains('submit|sign up|create account|send|subscribe|Συνέχεια')&quot;, &quot;form button:textcontains('submit|sign up|create account|send|subscribe|Συνέχεια')&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;<br/><br/></code></pre><p><strong>Q5: Why does few of my form's Dropdown / Radio / Multi-select fields are not captured in CRM?</strong></p><p>Field mapping algorithm maps the Dropdown values only if the data received for that particular field from your Form matches exactly (Case-sensitive) to any of the existing options present under that Dropdown. In order to verify this, compare the dropdown options present in the Form with the dropdown options present in the CRM. If any of the options are missing in CRM, you can create them. If you do this, dropdown fields capturing will work for the form.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q6: How to use smart forms script along with Webforms provided by CRM?</strong></p><p>1. Paste the webform installation script in the Website.</p><p>2. Since webform is going to create the lead in CRM upon form submission, we can turn-off the auto form capturing feature of the smart form by replacing &quot;true&quot; with &quot;false&quot; in the end of the Smart form's script. Now, you can paste the Smart form script in the Website's header / footer. With this, you can track user Page views and Events along with Web-to-Lead creation.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q7: Does Smart form script work if we keep it in Google Tag manager?</strong></p><p>It will work with Google Tag manager. But, make sure to include the Google Tag Manger script in your website's pages where forms exists.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q8: Is there any way to turn-off the Page visits tracking which is currently the default behaviour of Smart forms script?</strong></p><p>No. Currently there is no provision to turn-off the Page visits tracking.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q9: Can we use Smart forms script to track multiple websites or does it have any restriction?</strong></p><p>As of now we don't have restriction on the number of websites that you can track using Smart forms.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q10: How to send additional information to CRM upon form submission along with form details?</strong></p><p>This can be a common requirement if you want to track certain Geographic / Lead source details of the user who submitted the form. In order to achieve this, you can keep the fields with &quot;display:none&quot; property set in the form and dynamically fill the desired values in it. Smart forms script will capture the details present in these fields in the same way as rest of the fields.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Q11: What will happen if we send location details in the hallway data for a smart form?(Behaviour change)<br/><br/></strong></p><p>In such case we will not be overriding the location details.
