Agile processes harness change for </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">the customer's competitive advantage.</span></li><li><span>Frequent delivery of working software </span>– Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.</li><li><span>Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project </span>– <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Business people and developers must work </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">together daily throughout the project.</span></li><li><span>Support, trust, and motivate the people involved</span> – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams. <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Build projects around motivated individuals.</span><br style=""/><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Give them the environment and support they need, </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">and trust them to get the job done.</span></li><li><span>Enable face-to-face interactions </span>– <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The most efficient and effective method of </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">conveying information to and within a development </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">team is face-to-face conversation.</span></li><li><span>Working software is the primary measure of progress</span> – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.</li><li><span>Agile processes to support a consistent development pace </span>–<span> </span>Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.</li><li><span>Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility </span>– The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.</li><li><span>Simplicity</span> – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.  &quot;T<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">he art of maximising the amount </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">of work not done&quot;.</span></li><li><span>organising teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs </span>– Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.</li><li><span>Regular reflections on how to become more effective </span>– <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">At regular intervals, the team reflects on how </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts </span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">its behaviour accordingly.</span></li></ol>
